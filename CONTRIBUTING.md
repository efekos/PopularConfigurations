# Contribution

If you want to contribute to this project, you can do so in two ways:

* Find bugs, think of ideas and [open an issue](https://github.com/efekos/PopularConfigurations/issues) about them.
* Do your changes and [open a pull request](https://github.com/efekos/PopularConfigurations/pulls).

## Pull Request Guide

In order to start working on this project yourself:

* Clone the repository.
* Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
* Create a new branch with a concise name for your request.
* Do you changes. Follow a committing style similar to mine since it would look more organized if all commit messages were written in the same manner. [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) is not recommended but allowed.
* Open a pull request to merge your branch with the `master` branch.

You might have to change a few things in `pom.xml` files such as output paths or repository locations. It isn't a problem
as long as you don't commit those changes. **Any pull request that contains critical `pom.xml` changes will be rejected without
exception and the author will be asked to create a new pull request.**
